Final Project

/* 
My project in going to be a version of a binary tree. I am going to write a phone/address book program. In this program I will have a file with names, phone numbers, and addresses. From there I will add data into my address book, remove data from the address book, search through the data and find the data I am looing for in the address book, and I will change the data in the address book.
